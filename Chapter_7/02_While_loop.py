# Initialize i with 1
i = 1

# 'while' loop runs as long as i is less than 6
while (i < 6):
    print(i)  # Prints the current value of i
    i += 1    # Increments i by 1 after each loop iteration

# 'while' loop: A control structure that continues to execute as long as a specified condition is true.

# Dry Run:
# i = 1 -> prints 1 -> i becomes 2
# i = 2 -> prints 2 -> i becomes 3
# i = 3 -> prints 3 -> i becomes 4
# i = 4 -> prints 4 -> i becomes 5
# i = 5 -> prints 5 -> i becomes 6
# Loop ends as i is no longer less than 6.
