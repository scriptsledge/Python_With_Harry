# Set containing both integer and string representations of 18
vals = {18, "18"}

# Demonstrates that sets can hold different data types, even if values look similar
print(vals)  # Output: {18, '18'}

# Explanation:
# Since 18 (integer) and "18" (string) are different data types, they are treated as unique elements in the set.
